Poaching to meet growing demand from affluent Asian countries is driving up the rate of poaching and in some countries, political unrest contributes to elephant poaching."

			"African lion population has dropped 43% in 21 years.",
			"One of the main causes is the alarming rate at which they are losing their habitats due to expanding human populations and the resulting growth of agriculture, settlements, and roads which forces them into closer quarters with humans. This, coupled with a decrease in natural prey, causes them to attack livestock. Lions are often killed by farmers as a result or are hunted as rituals of bravery or as hunting trophies."
